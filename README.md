My .dotfiles
============

Clone.

    git clone https://github.com/nnevala/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

Run.

    cd ~/.dotfiles && sh update.sh

Profit.

*Note that this will modify the configuration files (.bash_profile, .gitconfig, etc...) in your home directory and something might break.*

Run at your own risk, please.
